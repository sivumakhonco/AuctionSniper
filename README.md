# Description

My implementation of the system ("The Auction Sniper") used in the book Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests.
The system allows the user to join an online auction for a given item, submit bids until a given maximum bid amount until
in the end the user either wins or loses.

While the implementation in the book is in Java Swing, this implementation uses .Net Core and related technologies, focusing
on the concepts presented in the book regarding test-driven development. The differences in technology, and the time that has
passed since the book was published, have necessitated that I make different choices to those in the book. However, the 
objective is to stay as close to the concepts outlined in the book as possible.

As I proceed with the implementation, you may follow my journey on my [Substask](https://smakhonco.substack.com/).
